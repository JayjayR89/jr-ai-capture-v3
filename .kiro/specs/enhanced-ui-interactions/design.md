# Design Document

## Overview

This design enhances the camera AI app with smooth animations, advanced TTS controls with audio scrubbing, responsive camera preview display, and comprehensive TTS engine configuration. The solution focuses on creating a polished user experience while maintaining performance and accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
CameraAIApp (Main Container)
├── CameraPreview (Enhanced with animations)
├── SettingsModal (Enhanced with TTS settings)
├── TTSControls (New component for audio controls)
├── AudioScrubBar (New component for progress tracking)
└── AnimationWrapper (New utility component)
```

### State Management
- **Animation State**: Track active animations and transitions
- **TTS State**: Manage audio playback, progress, and engine settings
- **Responsive State**: Handle device-specific display configurations
- **Settings State**: Extended to include TTS engine and voice configurations

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger animations through CSS transitions and React state
2. TTS requests use configured engine and voice settings from user preferences
3. Audio progress updates in real-time during playback
4. Camera preview adapts based on device detection and user settings

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced CameraPreview Component
```typescript
interface CameraPreviewProps {
  // Existing props...
  animationEnabled: boolean;
  onCameraFlip: () => Promise<void>; // Enhanced for animation support
  aspectRatio: 'desktop' | 'mobile'; // New prop for device-specific ratios
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Smooth camera flip animations with loading states
- Device-responsive aspect ratio handling (16:9 desktop, 9:16 mobile)
- Transition animations for camera state changes

### New TTSControls Component
```typescript
interface TTSControlsProps {
  text: string;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  duration: number;
  engine: 'standard' | 'neural' | 'generative';
  voice: TTSVoice;
  onPlay: () => void;
  onStop: () => void;
  onSeek: (time: number) => void;
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Play/Stop button management
- Integration with audio scrub bar
- TTS engine configuration application

### New AudioScrubBar Component
```typescript
interface AudioScrubBarProps {
  currentTime: number;
  duration: number;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  onSeek: (time: number) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Real-time progress visualization
- Interactive seeking functionality
- Time display formatting

### Enhanced SettingsModal Component
```typescript
interface TTSVoice {
  language: string;
  name: string;
  engine: 'standard' | 'neural' | 'generative';
  displayName: string;
}

interface EnhancedSettings extends Settings {
  ttsEngine: 'standard' | 'neural' | 'generative';
  ttsVoice: TTSVoice;
  animationsEnabled: boolean;
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- TTS engine selection UI
- Voice dropdown with proper language/engine mapping
- Settings modal layout fixes for proper scrolling

## Data Models

### TTS Configuration Model
```typescript
interface TTSConfig {
  engine: 'standard' | 'neural' | 'generative';
  voice: {
    language: string;
    name: string;
    displayName: string;
  };
}

const AVAILABLE_VOICES: TTSVoice[] = [
  { language: 'en-IE', name: 'Niamh', engine: 'neural', displayName: 'Niamh (Irish, Neural)' },
  { language: 'en-GB', name: 'Amy', engine: 'generative', displayName: 'Amy (British, Generative)' },
  { language: 'en-GB', name: 'Brian', engine: 'standard', displayName: 'Brian (British, Standard)' },
  { language: 'en-US', name: 'Mathew', engine: 'generative', displayName: 'Mathew (US, Generative)' },
  { language: 'en-US', name: 'Joanna', engine: 'neural', displayName: 'Joanna (US, Neural)' }
];
```

### Animation State Model
```typescript
interface AnimationState {
  cameraFlipping: boolean;
  transitionType: 'flip' | 'fade' | 'slide' | null;
  duration: number;
}
```

### Audio State Model
```typescript
interface AudioState {
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  duration: number;
  audioElement: HTMLAudioElement | null;
  playbackRate: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

### TTS Error Handling
- **Engine Unavailable**: Fallback to standard engine with user notification
- **Voice Not Found**: Default to first available voice for selected engine
- **Audio Playback Failure**: Clear audio state and show error toast
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### Animation Error Handling
- **CSS Transition Failures**: Graceful degradation to instant state changes
- **Performance Issues**: Automatic animation disabling on low-end devices
- **Browser Compatibility**: Feature detection and fallbacks

### Responsive Design Error Handling
- **Camera Access Issues**: Maintain aspect ratio with placeholder content
- **Device Detection Failures**: Default to desktop layout with manual override option

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **TTS Controls**: Test play/stop functionality, progress tracking, engine switching
- **Audio Scrub Bar**: Test seeking, time formatting, progress updates
- **Settings Modal**: Test voice selection, engine configuration, layout fixes
- **Animation Components**: Test state transitions, cleanup, performance

### Integration Testing
- **TTS Flow**: End-to-end testing of voice selection → engine configuration → audio playback
- **Camera Animations**: Test camera flip with various device configurations
- **Responsive Behavior**: Test aspect ratio changes across device types
- **Settings Persistence**: Test configuration saving and loading

### Performance Testing
- **Animation Performance**: Frame rate monitoring during transitions
- **Audio Latency**: Measure TTS response times across engines
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for audio element cleanup and memory leaks
- **Battery Impact**: Test animation and audio impact on mobile devices

### Accessibility Testing
- **Screen Reader Support**: Test TTS controls with assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **High Contrast**: Test visibility of progress bars and controls
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Technical Considerations

#### CSS Animations
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for hardware acceleration
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers

#### Audio Management
- Proper cleanup of audio elements to prevent memory leaks
- Handle multiple concurrent TTS requests
- Implement audio focus management

#### Responsive Design
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- Implement proper touch targets for mobile
- Consider viewport meta tag requirements

#### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load animation components
- Debounce audio progress updates
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
