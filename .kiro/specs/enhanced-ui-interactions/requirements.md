2. WHEN viewing TTS engine options THEN the system SHALL provide Standard, Neural, and Generative engine choices
3. WHEN the user selects an engine THEN the system SHALL apply that engine to all subsequent TTS operations
4. WHEN TTS functions are called THEN the system SHALL use the selected engine configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different voices for TTS, so that I can personalize the speech output to my preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing TTS settings THEN the system SHALL display a voice selection dropdown
2. WHEN viewing voice options THEN the system SHALL provide these choices: (en-IE, Niamh, Neural), (en-GB, Amy, Generative), (en-GB, Brian, Standard), (en-US, Mathew, Generative), (en-US, Joanna, Neural)
3. WHEN the user selects a voice THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the correct language code, voice name, and engine
4. WHEN TTS is executed THEN the system SHALL use the selected voice configuration including language, name, and engine parameters

### Requirement 6
