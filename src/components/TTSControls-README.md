## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/components/TTSControls.tsx` - Main component implementation
2. `src/components/TTSControlsDemo.tsx` - Demo component for testing
3. `src/components/TTSControlsTest.tsx` - Comprehensive test component

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/ImageGallery.tsx` - Replaced manual TTS implementation with TTSControls component

## üß™ Integration Points

### ImageGallery Integration
- Replaced manual TTS buttons with TTSControls component
- Removed old audio management code (audioRef, progress tracking, etc.)
- Simplified component state management
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving UX

### Usage Examples

```tsx
// Basic usage
<TTSControls text="Hello world" />

// With configuration
<TTSControls
  text="Hello world"
  config={{ voice: selectedVoice }}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  showScrubBar={true}
  onPlayStart={() => console.log('Started')}
  onPlayEnd={() => console.log('Ended')}
  onError={(error) => console.error(error)}
/>

// In ImageGallery (grid view)
<TTSControls
  text={image.description!}
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  className="w-full"
  showScrubBar={true}
/>

// In ImageGallery (modal view)
<TTSControls
  text={selectedImage.description!}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  showScrubBar={false}
  className="w-auto"
/>
```
